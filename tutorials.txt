**manage.py** is a script that helps with management of the site. With it we will be able (amongst other things) to start a web server on our computer without installing anything else.

The **settings.py** file contains the configuration of your website. you can change time zones,language and other stuff from there.

Remember when we talked about a mail carrier checking where to deliver a letter? **urls.py** file contains a list of patterns used by urlresolver.

Let's ignore the other files for now as we won't change them. The only thing to remember is not to delete them by accident!



**Database**

There's a lot of different database software that can store data for your site. We'll use the default one, sqlite3.

This is already set up in this part of your mysite/settings.py file.

To create a database for our site/project, let's run the following in the console: **python manage.py migrate**
we need to be in the project root directory that contains the manage.py file
